The server side of BC2: an out of the box contest control system

## Why
The de-facto competitive programming contest control system has been PC^2, but it has its flaws. For one, it's not open source. We have attended to too many contests where there are 2-3 hour delays simply because the hosts could not get PC^2 working properly.

## What
The goal of this project is to make a powerful, easy to use program that works out of the box with ample configuration and scripting options for advanced users, and a simple contest setup for new comers. The intention is to make this projec take the load off of contest hosts and contestants.
